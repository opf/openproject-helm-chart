# Deprecation notice

The helm chart has been updated and moved to https://github.com/opf/helm-charts/.

If you have installed OpenProject using the chart from this deprecated repo,
it's best to backup your OpenProject, do a fresh installation using the new helm chart,
and restoring the backup there.

Please refer to our [docs](https://www.openproject.org/docs/installation-and-operations/operation/restoring/#docker-based-installation) to find out more about backing up and restoring docker-based
OpenProject installations.
